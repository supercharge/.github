## About Supercharge

Supercharge is a Node.js framework with lots of batteries included. For example, Supercharge comes with configuration management, a solid HTTP layer supporting routes, middleware, cookies, file handling, sessions, and lots more. In contrast to other Node.js web frameworks (like Express, Fastify, and others) you donâ€™t need to Frankenstein together your app. Supercharge focuses on developer experience by providing a solid basis for you to start building:

- powerful and simple to use [HTTP routing](https://superchargejs.com/docs/routing)
- uses a [dependency injection container](https://superchargejs.com/docs/service-container)
